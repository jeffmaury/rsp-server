/**
 * This class is to keep track of which client is actively 
 * making a request on the server. 
 * 
 * While many tutorials online indicate not to use thread-local
 * with an executor service, and while the lsp launchers do use
 * an executor service, the fact is that each thread reads one
 * socket until that socket is closed, at which point the thread
 * may be repurposed for a new connection.
 * 
 * With that in mind, there can only possibly be one client per 
 * thread at any given time. 
 * 
 * Clients can use this to discover which client is making a given request
 * or to ensure all clients are authenticated for various purposes.
